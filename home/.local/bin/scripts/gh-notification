gh-notification is a tool that scrapes unread github notifications
It uses github-cli with meiji163/gh-notify addon to obtain the unread notifications
these are then parsed and sent as desktop notifications with notify-send

Options:
-a | --all: Also process already read notifications
-t | --temp-files: Show names of used temporary files for each notification
-v | --verbose: Shows info about what's happening.
-vv | --very-verbose: Implies --verbose, shows some more info about what's happening
-vvv | --very-very-verbose: Implies --very-verbose and --temp-files, shows even more details, usually just for debugging
-d | --dry-run: Run without sending any notificatinos, when ran with -r, this will also prevent any actual cache file removals
-nc | --no-cache: Ignore the cache and send all found notifications, even if they were already sent before.
-nd | --no-display: When the script is ran from headless mode (such as by crontab), this will still attempt to set the DISPLAY and send the desktop notification
-r | --reset: Resets notification cache (storing which notifications were already sent), skips notification sending, WARNING: removes the whole cache, regardless of '--all')
-u | --urgency [urgency-level]: pass over notify-send urgency attribute (low, normal, critical)
