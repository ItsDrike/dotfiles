# Compatibility executable script for applications running dmenu, which
# runs wofi in dmenu mode instead. Note: In many cases the arguments won't
# be compatible and this will fail, however the primary way scripts use
# dmenu is just for simple prompts, using the `-p` flag. and wofi does fully
# support this usage.

cat | wofi --dmenu $@
