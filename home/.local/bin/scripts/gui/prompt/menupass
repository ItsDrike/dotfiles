# This script is the a wrapper around menuprompt automatically passing options
# to prompt for a password. This is necessary for SUDO_ASKPASS variable, as it
# expects a path to a single executable.
#
# SUDO_ASKPASS is an environment variable that can be set to a path of an executable,
# which will run if sudo can't obtain password from terminal (stdin), i.e. running in
# a graphical application. This script will use menuprompt to obtain the plaintext
# password and which sudo will then read and verify.
#
# This is as safe as any other SUDO_ASKPASS program, and it needs to return the final
# password in plaintext for sudo to read it, however pipes retain the same filesystem user
# permissions and shouldn't be accessible to other non-priviledged users, so it's not
# a huge security issue, but know that it will deal with plaintext passwords.
#
# You can test whether this worked by running sudo -A echo "test", making sudo use the
# SUDO_ASKPASS program to obtain the password.
